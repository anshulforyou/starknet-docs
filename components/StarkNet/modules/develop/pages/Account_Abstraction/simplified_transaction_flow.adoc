= Simplified Transaction Flow

The key stages of transaction lifetime are:
* A new transaction is sent to the mempool with a nonce
* The sequencer selects a valid transaction from the mempool (inc nonce check)
* If valid the execute function is called
* If execute is successful, the transaction is added to a batch to be proved on-chain
